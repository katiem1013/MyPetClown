## The Process

This game was made over a long week to get some Unity practice in. I created all of the art for the game and then worked on getting the game working. It was inspired by a varity of pet games, and just wanted to create something simple. I knew that I wanted players to have to feed, clean and make sure the clown slept. Each stat gradually decreases as time passes so the player has to stay vigilant with keeping the clown happy. After the basics were done I added a food menu that the player has to buy from to keep the clown fed, after this I added a way to earn money. Each performance the clown earns money but gets more tired and hungry everytime. I then added a practice feature where the player can train the clown to be better and earn more money as a result.
